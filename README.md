## Contributors

## About
  - This project is the backend api for a project called NeighborHub. It is built with Ruby on Rails (Ruby 2.4.1 and Rails 5.2.1). See it live [here](https://neighborhub-api.herokuapp.com).  
  - The front end can be viewed at [NeighborHub](https://neighborhood-kickstarter.herokuapp.com), and the repo for the front end can be found [here](https://github.com/dmiller1623/Neighborhood-Kickstarter).  
  - There is also another associated backend api that handles sending an email when a user creates an account; this repo can be found [here](https://github.com/duranangela/NeighborHubEmail).
